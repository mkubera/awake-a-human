### The game
Awake a Human: a dice game

### Description
Awake a human being! Feed every Portion (Mind, Heart, Spirit, Body) while making sure that Doubts do not bring any Portion to the level of self-doubtfulness.

### Note
This is a mangy-looking prototype of a little game that I hope will prove to be of value once finished :-)
